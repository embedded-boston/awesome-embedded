- [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/)  - A free OS for IoT devices providing foundational trust services. The trust services include device identity, sealing, attestation, and data integrity. The term “Robust” is used because the minimal trusted computing base is tiny, and because RIoT capabilities can remotely re-establish trust in devices that have been compromised by malware.
- [Rocket](http://www.windriver.com/products/operating-systems/rocket/) - A free embedded operating system specifically designed to quickly and easily build small, intelligent devices in Wind Rivers cloud-based development environment, Wind River Helix™ App Cloud.

- [Fuschia](https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/magenta) - Magenta is the core platform that powers the Fuchsia OS. Magenta is composed of a microkernel (source in kernel/...) as well as a small set of userspace services, drivers, and libraries (source in system/...) necessary for the system to boot, talk to hardware, load userspace processes and run them, etc. Fuchsia builds a much larger OS on top of this foundation.
- [TI-RTOS](www.ti.com/tool/ti-rtos) - A real-time operating system for TI microcontrollers, It Includes TCP/IP and USB stacks, a FAT file system, and device drivers, Most of the TI-RTOS components are released under the BSD License.

- [Mockitopp](https://github.com/tpounds/mockitopp) - A C++ mocking framework inspired by the ideas developed for Mockito written by Szczepan Faber, et al. The purpose is to provide similar construction semantics for creating mock objects leading to smaller, more readable test cases. It is designed to be a lightweight framework allowing you to mock dependencies for a system under test using a simple descriptive domain specific language. The goal is to help create simpler, less brittle test cases; ultimately, leading to less maintenance overhead in the future.
